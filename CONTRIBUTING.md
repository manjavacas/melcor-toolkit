## Pull requests

If you want to collaborate in the development of MELKIT through a pull request, please follow these steps:

* Create an **issue** where you outline the work to be done.
* Clone the repository and start coding! Be sure to work on the most recent version of the project, and on a branch whose name specifies the type of issue addressed (e.g. `feature-<issue>`, `bug-<issue>`). Do not forget to install `requirements.txt`.
* If your change requires it, please remember to update the project documentation.
* Once the work is finished, publish your pull request. Explain your changes using the proposed template.
* Remember to assign a reviewer and indicate which issues were addressed or your pull request is closing.
