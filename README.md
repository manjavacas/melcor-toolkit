# MELKIT: _the MELCOR toolkit_ 🧰

A set of tools designed to facilitate the handling of MELCOR/MELGEN files.

## ⚙️ Utilities

- Reading Control Volumes (`CVs`) and Flow Paths (`FLs`) and converting them to objects.
- Writing, deleting and editing `CVs` and `FLs`.
- Plotting files generated by the `EDF` package.
- Extraction of final values for variables monitored by EDF.
- Obtaining the list of available/used IDs for certain objects (`CVs`, `FLs`).
- Remove all comments from an input file.
- Search for objects by their ID.
- Search for duplicate objects in a given list.

## 💻 How to use

You simply need to instantiate a `Toolkit` with the name of the MELGEN file to manipulate and call those functions. For example:

```
toolkit = Toolkit(filename)
cvs = toolkit.read_cvs()
```
